Naive:
1. Create a map of type Node as key and Node as value as well.
2. Traverse the linked list, for every node in original list create a new node and populate just the value (leave out next and random)
3. Now traverse the map, for each key node, update the value node's next and random with map[key.next] and ma[key.random] respectively
4. Return map[head]

Optimal:
