BruteForce:
1. Iterate one list in one loop and the other in an inner loop
2. If current node of first list matches the current node inner list return node, remember compare the whole ndoe and not just valuse
3. If no such common node encountered, return nil at the end of both loops

Difference of lists:
1. Find lengths of both lists by traversing both of them
2. Find the positive difference
3. Traverse the bigger list by the diff
4. Start traversing both list now by 1 step and check equality at each interval
5. Return the node if matched, else return nil

Hashing:
1. Iterate through list1 and store each node in a map as key
2. Iterate through list2 and check for the currNode in the map
3. If found return currNode
4. At the end if nothing found return nil
