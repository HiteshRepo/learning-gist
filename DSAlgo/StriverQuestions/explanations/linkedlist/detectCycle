HashMap:
1. create a map of key as ListNode type and value as any [maybe struct]
2. iterate through the linked list, condition is till the list reaches end
3. on every iteration check if the curr node is in map
4. if found, return true
5. else store the curr node as key in map
6. if we reach the end of the linked list without getting any of the nodes again, return false
7. if we want to return the node where the cycle began, we can the tmp node instead of bool

slow and fast:
1. take two pointers slow and fast
2. assign head to both of them
3. iterate till fast != nil and fast.Next != nil
4. for every iteration
    move fast by 2 steps
    move slow by 1 step
    check if slow == fast, if they collide, return true
6. return false if fast reaches end
7. if we want to return the node where the cycle began, then where we detect slow == fast, we need to start another inner loop
    that runs till slow == entry, entry is another node starting from head, move both pointers by 1 step and wherever they collide is the cycle head
