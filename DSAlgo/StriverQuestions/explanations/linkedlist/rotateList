BruteForce
1. we require 3 pointers: first, last and secondLast
2. we also require 2 loops
3. outer loop is for rotating the list the given number of times
4. inner loop is for finding the last and second last node
5. in the inner loop we find the last node and secondLast node and do following operations:
    we set last.next = first
    we also set secondLast.Next = nil
    we finally set first = last
6. we increase the count after each iteration
7. the outer loop will run for the given number of rotation counts
8. finally we return the first node

Optimal
1. Since we are rotating the list, if the given number of times is greater than the length of the list
    then we are basically repeating the same rotation again
2. So instead we will find the real given number of times, we can do that by using the formula
    k = k%length
    and targetNode = length - k
3. we first find the length of list
4. Then we point the last node to first and make it cyclic
5. We then figure out the targetNode using the formula
6. Finally we traverse the list from start till the target node and break its link with its next
7. Then we return the head of the result list
