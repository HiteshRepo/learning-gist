Brute force:
1. Just iterate from 0 to n
2. While iterating multiply the number with itself
3. Edge case: if n is negative, divide 1 by ans
4. Return ans
5. O(n)

Optimized:
1. Just iterate from n to 0
2. If n is even, decrease it by half, multiply number's pow till now with number's pow till now
3. If n is odd, decrease it by 1, multiply number's pow till now with itself
4. Edge case: if n is negative, divide 1 by ans
5. Return ans
