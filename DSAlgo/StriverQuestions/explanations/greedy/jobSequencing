Solution:
1. Problem statement is to figure out a way to generate max profit with as many jobs possible to perform.
2. So in order to achieve this, we need to sort the given jobs in descending order of the profits.
3. Then find out the max deadline.
4. Create an empty array to store job info of length equal to max deadline.
5. Iterate through the jobs.
6. Check deadline and place it in the highest possible deadline.
7. Skip if not possible within deadline.
8. Repeat this for each job.
9. Count the number of jobs accommodated and combined profit.
10 Return the count and profit as an array.
