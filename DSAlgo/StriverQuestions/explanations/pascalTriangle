Observations & Create pascals triangle:
    Always 1st and last column of every column is 1
    Middle elements are formed by adding upper rows consecutive elements
    Every row num has that many columns, 5th row has 5 columns

Element at 5th Row and 3rd Column:
    Formula: R-1 C C-1 = 4 C 2 = 4*3 / 2*1 = 6

Print nTh row
    Brute force: nCr for each column of nTh row - O(n2)
    Optimized: n * n-i / i+1 -> nCr of of 0th column followed by a pattern of multiplying something and divide something
