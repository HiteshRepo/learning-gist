Solution:
1. Pick a starting node
2. Add a color to it starting from 1
3. Go to its neighbor
4. Start with color 1
5. Check if the color can be applied (cannot be applied if any 1 of its neighbor has the same color)
6. If can be applied, add the color to it
7. Return true if the next node is already colored
8. Else clear the color applied to the current node, because the color applied to current node did not let its nbr apply any other color. Hence need to try with a different color for current node.
