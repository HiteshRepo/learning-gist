Solution:
1. How to find permutations recursively?
       1. For each index, run iteration for that index till end of list
       2. For each iteration of current index follow below steps
           1. Swap the index and current iteration position elements in the array/string
           2. Recursively call the function with increased index by 1
           3. Un-swap the index and the current iteration position
       3. Breaking clause: if index is equal to length of array, then store the current string in the results bucket
