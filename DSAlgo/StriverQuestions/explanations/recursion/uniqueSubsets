Recursive Solution
1. We need to get all subsets recursively.
2. The break clause would be if current index is equal to length of array, then append the current subset to results subset after removing nulls
3. If break clause is not met, then either consider the current index element or not
4. But recursively call the function with an increased index for both the scenarios
5. But before adding the subset to result subsets, we need to check if the current subset that we are about to add is present already or not
6. A good way to do that would be to maintain a separate map that can store the subsets as key in form of strings
