Approach:
1. We are going to follow a property that is as follows
    1. If we take an array, where sum of elements is say S
    2. If we say that the sum of elements till index i say is S
    3. Then what would be the sum of rest of the elements, that would be 0. right?
2. Now we will apply the above property to our given array
3. We will use 3 things to start with
    1. we need a map to store sum until now and its index
    2. we need a variable to track maximumLength
    3. we need a variable to store prefix sum
4. Given an array of 1,-1,3,2,-2,-8,1,7,10,2,3
5. we will increment the prefixSum by the element
6. we will check if the prefixSum till this point is 0 or not
7. if it is zero, then we just increase our maxLen
8. else we check if the prefixSum is present in the bucket or not
9. if present, then we apply our principle and subtract the current index with stored prefixSum's index to get length of the current '0 sum sub-array'
10. Also, we compare it with maxLen and update it if greater
