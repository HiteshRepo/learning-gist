BruteForce
1. Amount of water trapped at that point/height is min of max of left heights and max of right heights minus height at of the current
2. So we run a loop from 0 to N
3. find max to the left and store in lmax
4. find max to the right and store in rmax
5. find min of lmax and rmax
6. subtract current height from the computed min
7. add the result to the trap
8. return trap

Optimal
1. We can optimize the previous approach just by pre computing the lmax and rmax of different heights
    instead of doing it repeatedly for every height
