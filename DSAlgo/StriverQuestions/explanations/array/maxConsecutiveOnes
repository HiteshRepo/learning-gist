Solution:
1. take a variable to store max consecutive ones
2. take another variable to store current consecutive ones
3. iterate through the list, and if 1 is encountered then increment currOnes by 1
    else re initialize currOnes with 0
4. also in each iteration check if currOnes is greater than maxOnes,
if currOnes is greater then assign maxOnes with currOnes
