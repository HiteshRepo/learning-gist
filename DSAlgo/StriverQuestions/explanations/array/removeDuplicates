BruteForce
1. Create a map to store unique numbers fro given array
2. Iterate through the given array and store only unique numbers in the map
3. Iterate through the map and replace the values from map incrementally in the given array
4. Return length of the map

Optimized:
1. take a pointer i and assign 0 to it
2. start a loop and iterate from 1 to len of array, let loop var be j
3. if arr[j] != arr[i], then increase i by 1 and then replace arr[i] with arr[j]
4. at the end of loop, return i+1
