Brute force:
1. for every i check if there is any element greater than it and what is the max positive difference
2. return the max difference which will be max profit
3. O(n2)

Optimized:
1. linearly traverse the array
2. keep track of min price
3. also keep track for max profit, current day's price - minPrice
4. return maxProfit
