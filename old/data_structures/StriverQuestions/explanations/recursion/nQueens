Solution:
1. In order to solve this problem, we need to do following activities for each row
    1. Iterate through each column
    2. Check if the column of the current row is valid or not
    3. What makes a column of the current row valid
        1. No Queens present in the row
        2. No Queens present in the column
        3. No Queens present in the diagonals (top-right, top-left, bottom-right and bottom-left)
    4. If the column of the current row is valid, mark the column in the grid with a 'Q' and recursively call for next row
    5. Also while backtracking, clear the marked column in the grid (make it '.')
2. The breaking clause is:
    If the current row is equal to length of matrix, save current grid to the ans
