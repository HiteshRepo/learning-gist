Solution:
1. We have to satisfy 3 conditions:
    1. All rows should have 1-9 exactly once
    2. All columns should have 1-9 exactly once
    3. Each 3*3 submatrix should be filled with 1-9 exactly once
2. In order to do this, for each number we need to do the below activities
    1. If the current number can be placed on current row and current column or not
    2. In order to check is current number can be placed on current row and current column or not, we have to do below:
        1. Check if the current number is already present in current row - if present then the current number cannot be placed
        2. Check if the current number is already present in current column - if present then the current number cannot be placed
        3. Check if the current number is already present in current submatrix - if present then the current number cannot be placed
    3. If not present, then place the value at the current row and column of the board and recursively call for the next row and next column
3. Even before step #2, we need to compute next row and next column
    1. if current column is 8, next row would be current row + 1 and next column would be 0
    2. else, next row would be current row and next column would be current column + 1
4. Also before step#2, check if current row and current column in the board already has a number, then directly recurse for next row and column
