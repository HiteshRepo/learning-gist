Iterative solution
1. Get all subsets iteratively.
2. Then calculate the sum of each subset and sort the results.
3. Then return the results.
4. Getting all the subsets is the task here.
5. Take a result array that will be a 2D array which will store all the subsets
6. Take a outer for loop, that will iterate through the given array.
7. The inner for loop will iterate through the resultArray.
8. In the inner for loop below actions will be performed
    1. add the current element (which is directed by outer loop) to the current subset (which is directed by inner loop)
    2. then add the resultant subset to the results superset

Recursive Solution
1. Get all subsets recursively.
2. Then calculate the sum of each subset and sort the results.
3. Then return the results.
4. Getting all the subsets is the task here.
5. The break clause would be if current index is equal to length of array, then append the current subset to results subset after removing nulls
6. If break clause is not met, then either consider the current index element or not
7. But recursively call the function with an increased index for both the scenarios
