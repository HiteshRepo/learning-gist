Solution
1. Sort the coins in ascending order.
2. Start iteration from back of the coins array.
3. Skip the coin if it is greater than the given value.
4. If not skipped, decrease the value by the coin value and increment count of coin by 1.
5. Run the iteration till either loop finishes or value is fulfilled.
