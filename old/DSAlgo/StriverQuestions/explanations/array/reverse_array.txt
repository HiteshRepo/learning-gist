Using merge sort:
1. In merge sort what we do is divide and conquer.
2. In Divide, we keep on splitting the original array to several arrays of single elements.
3. In Conquer, we merge those arrays back but this time sort them as well.
4. For our solution, we will divide the array and while conquering we will figure out our solution.
5. While merging the sorted arrays,
    for every element in left array we will find out with how many element of right array it can form reverse pair
    and that becomes our count for that level.
6. As we remember from our question, reverse pair should satisfy a[i] > 2*a[j].
7. In this solution i represents elements in left array while j represents elements in right array
8. So we add up the counts from each level to find our answer
