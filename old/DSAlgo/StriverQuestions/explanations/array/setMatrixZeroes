Brute force:
1. Traverse over the entire matrix
2. Whenever a zero is encountered, traverse through its row and column and replace the value with anything other than 0,1 say -1
3. But do not replace O with anything, because we might miss its impact on other rows and columns
4. Change all the -1 to 0
5. (m*n) + (m+n)

Optimized:
1. Take 2 dummy matrices, one matrix of size equal to size of row and another equal to size of column
2. Traverse linearly over the matrix
3. If you find a zero, then mark the corresponding row array and column array as 0
4. Then traverse over the matrix again, check the dummy arrays
5. If any one of them has a 0, then make it as 0.
