Solution:
1. The intuition behind such use cases which involves combinations or subsequences is recursion
2. Also while in recursion, pick up and not pick up scenario comes to mind
3. In this we shall follow a similar strategy as in finding unique subsets
4. For every index of array, we shall either pick or not pick
5. When we pick we shall not increase the index and also reduce the target by the number picked
6. But while backtracking we shall remove the last picked
7. When not picked, we just increase the index and leave the target untouched
8. The break clause will check for index = len(arr)
9. Also it will add to the results only if target is 0
