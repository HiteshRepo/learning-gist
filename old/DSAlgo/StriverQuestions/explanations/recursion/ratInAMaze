Solution:
1. Our goal is to reach the last position in the matrix from the first position in the matrix.
2. We cannot move over 0 as it is a blocked path.
3. Our result should be in lexicographical order.
4. Once visited the path cannot be travelled again.
5. If first block is 0, then we cannot move at all.
6. So there are four directions allowed to move, D (down), L (left), R (right), U (up).
7. In order to keep our result lexicographical, we will attempt to move in the same order.
8. When we move D, row increases by 1 and column stays the same.
9. When we move U, row decreases by 1 and column stays the same.
10. When we move L, row stays the same and column decreases by 1.
11. When we move R, row stays the same and column increases by 1.
12. Before we move, we mark that position as visited.
13. While backtracking we make that position unvisited again.
