Solution:
1. First we create 2 nodes tmp and head
2. tmp is an empty node, val is 0 and next is nil
3. head is equal to tmp, not pointing to tmp as per linked list domain
4. we take 2 variables sum and carry and assign them as 0
5. we iterate till l1 == nil or l2 == nil or carry > 0
6. if l1 is not null, we add l1's val to sum
7. if l2 is not null, we add l2's val to sum
8. if carry is greater than 0, then we add carry to sum
9. no we create a new empty node
10. if sum > 0, we assign new node's val with sum%10 and carry with sum/10
11. else we assign new node's val with sum itself
12. we assign tmp.Next with new node
13. then we move tmp to the new node itself
14. after the iteration, we return head.next
